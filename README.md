##Nothing to see here yet (more to see later)
Enigma is a personal project which consists of a free messaging application.  
It will provide **real privacy** unlike other messaging solutions (more info about encryption methods later, keys etc).  
This file will have more info in it later.  
Anyone will be able to install it on a dedicated server and share the server's ip with friends to exchange messages privately.  

There will probably be an enterprise version with more functionalities but its development will start
only when the "community" version will be finished.
